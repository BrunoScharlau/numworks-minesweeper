# Minesweeper for Numworks
Have you ever wanted to play the classic Minesweeper game on your Numworks calculator ? Here you go!

## Installation
Installation is extremely simple: you just download (or copy-paste) this script and save it as a new script on the [Numworks Workshop website](https://workshop.numworks.com/). You'll then be able to upload it to your calculator from the website. Everything just works! No custom OS required.

## Usage
To start a new game, just run `minesweeper.py` on your calculator, like you usually do for other Python scripts. The user interface will then load, and you'll be able to start playing. If you want to quit the game, just press the `Back` key a couple of times, and this should make you exit the program.

## Controls
 - To move around the playing field, use the arrow keys
 - To hit a cell, use the `OK` button
 - To mark a cell as a mine, use the `Backspace (clear)` key
